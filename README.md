## Tutorial Notes
### Classical Information 
* Presented in bits, which can only be on or off (binary numbers)
* Important for prompt: converting decimal to binary
### Classical Information vs Quantum Information 
* Classical: 101 = 5
* Quantum: 00(1|0) = 001 or 000 
    * The last bit can be 0 or 1 (superposition)
